# Text_Extraction
This project is for extracting letters from images using neural networks through MATLAB

# Prerequisites
To run this code, you will need a copy of MATLAB 2018 installed with the Deep Learning Toolbox.
Understanding of the architecture anf algorithm of VGG-16 and concepts of Transfer Learning is also useful.

# Installation
Matlab installation - https://in.mathworks.com/help/compiler_sdk/dotnet/install-the-matlab-runtime.html
Deep Learning Toolbox for Matlab - https://in.mathworks.com/products/deep-learning.html 

# Instructions
Before running the code, load the database and place it in the respective folders:
1. Training images - Training folder in handwritten-characters folder
2. Test images - Validation folder in handwritten-characters folder
Make sure the folders are named exactly according to as mentioned in the code.
i.e. All images of a (capital or small) in a folder named 'A', etc.
You could also simply download the dataset from the link mentioned below and place it accordingly.
